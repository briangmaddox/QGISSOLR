# QGISSOLR
QGIS 3.x Plugin for loading SOLR tables.

This is an old project I did for loading SOLR tables with geospatial data into QGIS. If you use this,
you will likely need to modify for your specific purpose.

## Requirements
It's meant to be self-contained, so it contains copies of iso3166 and pysolr.

## Usage
Copy to your QGIS3 plugins directory and enable.
